p800
tp801
a(g777
I12
S'oh, and they also have these "grilled footlong hot dogs," but beware - they aren\'t your ordinary hot dogs, they\'re more like these enormous sausages & they\'re rather oily/greasy...not for the faint of heart (and the reason they\'re like five/six bucks or something like that).'
p802
tp803
a(g777

S'my boss (a very well-traveled man, who has a refined palate and deep appreciation for high-quality food) ordered the seafood pasta and told me afterwards that it was not only the highlight among all his meals that week in vegas, but also one of the best dishes he had ever enjoyed in his life.'
